Website Description:
   The website showcases three pages designed with an About Me page, Portfolio of work, and Contact page. 

   Starting with the About Me page, the user can use the navigation pane in the upper right corner to move through the website to the Portfolio page or the Contact page. 

Technologies Used:
   HTML
   CSS
   Bootstrap

Challenges:
   I had issues building with Bootstrap and formatting the page as preferred. I learned a lot about styling in CSS and styling with Bootstrap. 

   I worked in the web browser under "Inspect" to see the errors in styling and where they were coming from.
